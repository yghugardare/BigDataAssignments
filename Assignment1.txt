## Assignment Part-1
Q1. Why do we call Python as a general purpose and high-level programming language?
A1)#1-Python is called as general purpose language because it can be used in variuos fields such as Artificial intelegence,Big Data,Data Science,Web Development,gaming,etc.
#2-Python is a high level programing language as it enables development of a program in a much more user-friendly programming context and is generally independent of the computer's hardware architecture.

Q2. Why is Python called a dynamically typed language?
A2)#1)Python is dynamically typed as we do not have to specify data type for variable and manage memory while assigning value to a variable
#2)for example, In c++ we have to decalre variable like this-    int x = 10;
But, in python it is simple -  x=10


Q3. List some pros and cons of Python programming language?
A3)Pros-
#1)Easy to understand
#2)used in various fields
#3)dynamically typed programming language
#4)High level and supports Object oriented programming
Cons-
#1)slower than other languages
#2)Not memory efficient 

Q4. In what all domains can we use Python?
A4)Domains such as-
#1)Data Science
#2)AI and machine learning
#3)Big Data
#4)Web Development
#5)Gaming
#6)Automation

Q5. What are variable and how can we declare them?
A5)#1)Variable- It is a name given to specific memory location.
#2)to declare -      name='Yash'
					age = 22;

Q6. How can we take an input from the user in Python?
A6)Syntac for input-
  name = input("Enter your name: ")
  age = int(input("Enter you age:"))

Q7. What is the default datatype of the value that has been taken as an input using input() function?
A7)String is the default datatype of the value that has been taken as an input using input() function

Q8. What is type casting?
A8)Type Casting is conversion from one data type to another data type

Q9. Can we take more than one input from the user using single input() function? If yes, how? If no, why?
A9)Yes, we can do it using for loop
for i in range(0,2):
	name = input()

Q10. What are keywords?
A10)Python keywords are special reserved words that have specific meanings and purposes and can't be used for anything but those specific purposes.Eg)int,float,class,string,etc

Q11. Can we use keywords as a variable? Support your answer with reason.
A11)No, because keywords have predefined meanings.

Q12. What is indentation? What's the use of indentaion in Python?
A12)#1)Indentation are white spaces that are added to the code.
#2)They provide readablity to users giving, as blocks of code can be represented using them.

Q13. How can we throw some output in Python?
A13)print("ineuron BigData 2.0")

Q14. What are operators in Python?
A14)There are 5 types of operators in python-
#1)Numerical operators- +,-,/,/,//,%,*,**
#2)String operator- +(Concatenation)
#3)Assignment operator-  =, +=, -=,/=,etc
#4)Comparison - ==,>,<,>=,<=,!=
#5)Logical - and , or , not

Q15. What is difference between / and // operators?
A15) #1) /  -Float  division: gives quotient in float,
#2) //  -Integer  division: gives quotient in integer.

Q16. Write a code that gives following as an output.
print("' ```\n '")
print("iNeuroniNeuroniNeuroniNeuron\n")
print("' ```\n '")
```
iNeuroniNeuroniNeuroniNeuron
```

Q17. Write a code to take a number as an input from the user and check if the number is odd or even.
number = int(input())
if number%2==0:
	print('even')
else:
	print('odd')

Q18. What are boolean operator?
A18)Boolean operators are operators that return boolean value(like True and False).They are used to check some conditions.
Example- and , or and not

Q19. What will the output of the following?
```
1 or 0    --->  1

0 and 0     --->  0

True and False and True     --->  False

1 or 0 or 0    --->  1
```

Q20. What are conditional statements in Python?
A20) Conditional statements in python are- if, else and elif

Q21. What is use of 'if', 'elif' and 'else' keywords?
A21)if statement -- used to showcase a condition
#2)elif statement -- used to showcase multiple conditonal statements

Q22. Write a code to take the age of person as an input and if age >= 18 display "I can vote". If age is < 18 display "I can't vote".
A22) age = int(input())
if age >=18:
	print("I can vote")
else:
	print("I can't vote")

Q23. Write a code that displays the sum of all the even numbers from the given list.
```
numbers = [12, 75, 150, 180, 145, 525, 50]
```
A23)sum = 0
for i in range(0,len(numbers)):
	if(numbers[i] % 2 == 0):
		sum += numbers[i]
	i+=1
print(sum)

Q24. Write a code to take 3 numbers as an input from the user and display the greatest no as output.
a = int(input())
b = int(input())
c = int(input())
if a > b:
	print(a)
elif a  < b:
	print(b)
else:
	print(c)

Q25. Write a program to display only those numbers from a list that satisfy the following conditions

- The number must be divisible by five

- If the number is greater than 150, then skip it and move to the next number

- If the number is greater than 500, then stop the loop
```
numbers = [12, 75, 150, 180, 145, 525, 50]
```
A25)
 for i in range(0, len(numbers)):
	if(i % 5 == 0):
		if(i >  150):
			continue	
		elif(i> 500):
			break
		else:
			print(i)
